# Tourni App (Uncompleted)

Tourni is a tournament App
Made in C#

## Features

- Register & Login for Local DB
- Nothing is made for the backend currently

> There is no a big reason or anything behind tourni app it's just that currently I want to make a small tournament app
Maybe in the future I will try to make it use for big tournaments


First Tab:

```sh
install realTaiizor in the nuget package installer in visual studio
```

Second Tab:
```
check what dependecies are required to run it on visual studio
gulp watch
```

Third:
```
if everything is set then you can run but there is only the frontend
```
