# Tourni App (Uncompleted)

Tourni is a tournament App
Made in C#

## Features

- Nothing is made for the backend currently

> There is no a big reason or anything behind tourni app it's just that currently I want to make a small tournament app
Maybe in the future I will try to make it use for big tournaments

```

Second Tab:
